        <p>Alright so Bob Dylan wasn&#8217;t impressed with critics, as expressed in his song <cite>Ballad of a Thin Man</cite>. Troubadours rarely are. I&#8217;m paraphrasing his song title to name my new reviews site nonetheless.</p>

        <p>The arts have always been a major part of my life. So I thought I&#8217;d start writing about culture in all its forms to share my enthusiasm for what it can do for us. I like to think I have some idea of what&#8217;s happening here.</p>
